## üìå **About Me**  

I have experience working with a variety of **cloud technologies** and **automation tools**. My primary focus has been to help organizations build **secure**, **scalable**, and **automated cloud infrastructures** that can grow with the needs of the business. I enjoy solving complex problems with **infrastructure-as-code (IaC)**, containerization, and continuous integration/deployment practices.

I aim to keep learning and growing by leveraging **cloud computing** to build efficient, high-performance systems. Whether it's automating deployment pipelines or managing large-scale cloud resources, I'm always looking for ways to optimize operations and improve system reliability.
